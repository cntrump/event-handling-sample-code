 A NSViewController subclass showing how to use IBActions to manipulate a view.

    @IBOutlet weak var dotView: DotView!

    // radiusChanged(_:) is an action method which lets you change the radius of the dot.
    // A possible optimization is to check to see if the old and new value is the same,
    // and not do anything if so.

        dotView.radius = CGFloat(sender.doubleValue)
    }

    // colorChanged(_:) is an action method which lets you change the color of the dot.

    // The recommended way to handle events is to override NSResponder (superclass
    // of NSView) methods in the NSView subclass. One such method is mouseUp(with:).
    // These methods get the event as the argument. The event has the mouse
    // location in window coordinates; use convert(_:from:) (with "nil"
    // as the view argument) to convert this point to view coordinates local
    // to dotView.
    //
    // Note that once we set the new center, needsDisplay is set to true in the center
    // property's didSet observer to mark that the view needs to be redisplayed (which
    // is done automatically by AppKit).
    override func mouseUp(with event: NSEvent) {
        let eventLocation = event.locationInWindow
        dotView.center = dotView.convert(eventLocation, from: nil)
